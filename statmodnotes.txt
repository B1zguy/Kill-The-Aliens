general bugs:
- saucer stuck on explosion, replicated several times at this point
- don't respawn over saucer

steps to go:
+ speed up map movement for speedup statmod
*- implement additional bullets for moreguns powerup
	- bamf mode for ship
+ implement time tracking and powerup reversal
+ new art for statmods
- possibly limit number of statmods available on screen
- create animation upon positive statmod change
- must reset more guns on death

status modifier implementation bugs:
- ship explosion in random places
	- connected to getting speed power up, we are running into our own bullet again
	- perhaps increase bullet speed with ship speed
	- seems to be fixed by changing bullet speed to 13
- one up not increasing health
	- seems to be working
+ need to remove statmods after they leave screen
