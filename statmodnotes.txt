general bugs:
- saucer stuck on explosion, replicated several times at this point
- don't respawn over saucer

steps to go:
+ speed up map movement for speedup statmod
+ implement additional bullets for moreguns powerup
+ implement time tracking and powerup reversal
+ new art for statmods
- possibly limit number of statmods available on screen
- create animation upon positive statmod change
+ must reset more guns on death
- work out probabilities
- improve art for statmods
+ remove debug messages
- random engine does not have enough entropy
- adjust trajectory angles on the fly for non linear movement
