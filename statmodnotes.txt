general bugs:
- saucer stuck on explosion, replicated several times at this point
- don't respawn over saucer

steps to go:
- speed up map movement for speedup statmod
- implement time tracking and powerup reversal
+ new art for statmods
- possibly limit number of statmods available on screen
- create animation upon positive statmod change

status modifier implementation bugs:
- ship explosion in random places
- one up not increasing health
+ need to remove statmods after they leave screen
