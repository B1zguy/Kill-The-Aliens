general bugs:
- saucer stuck on explosion, replicated several times at this point
- don't respawn over saucer

steps to go:
- speed up map movement for speedup statmod
- implement additional bullets for moreguns powerup
**- implement time tracking and powerup reversal
	- how to check if ship had died?
		- if ship.exploding == particular frame
+ new art for statmods
- possibly limit number of statmods available on screen
- create animation upon positive statmod change

status modifier implementation bugs:
- ship explosion in random places
	- connected to getting speed power up, we are running into our own bullet again
	- perhaps increase bullet speed with ship speed
- one up not increasing health
	- seems to be working
+ need to remove statmods after they leave screen
